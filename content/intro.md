Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the research paper: **Tampuu A, Matiisen T, Ólafsdóttir HF, Barry C, Vicente R (2019) [*Efficient neural decoding of self-location with a deep recurrent network*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006822#abstract0). 
<br> PLoS Comput Biol 15(2): e1006822. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006822**

It reports that the application of RNNs to neural data allowed flexible integration of temporal context, yielding improved accuracy relative to the more commonly used Bayesian approaches and opens new avenues for exploration of the neural code.

This Jupyter Book reproduces their paper figures, and lets you interact with them. You can edit and run the code inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook interface in new window. The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com). 

All of the code is contained inside one Jupyter notebook that uses [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/running.html#content) (Script of Scripts) workflow to enable communication between Python2 and Python3 kernels.
